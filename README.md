# Project Description
The purpose of this site is to have centralized place for examples of linux commands. The goal is to have general, easily accesible place to find examples of commands for individuals who are getting  started with Linux. My motivation for creating this space came from the fact that for a beginner, the command line is intimidating because it is not user friendly. No one will always remember the sintax of every command they ever used. Please provide as much feedback as you can and if you want to conribute, you can reach out to me here: linuxworkshop67@gmail.com
